# My Personal Portfolio Website

I have developed a responsive personal portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects. The front-end of the website is crafted using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

## Key Features:

- **CSS Magic:**
  - Implemented CSS to create engaging features, such as transitions on my photo.
  - Included an interactive element where clicking on the moon image dynamically changes the background color.

- **Navigation Bar:**
  - The portfolio website features a well-designed navigation bar for easy navigation.

- **Sections:**
  - Organized content into distinct sections, including Home, About, Skills, Service, Contact, Download CV button, and Hire Me button.
